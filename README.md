This R package provided a programmatic interface to the [Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase][BD] of the [DSMZ (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures)][DMSZ].

As of [June 2021, BacDive's "redesign"](https://twitter.com/BacDive/status/1409481626367758341) has rendered this R package inoperable.
Apparently, they want you to use [either of these clients](https://api.bacdive.dsmz.de/client_examples).

# Old README below

BacDiveR helps you improve your research on bacteria and archaea by providing access to "structured information on [...] their taxonomy, morphology, physiology, cultivation, geographic origin, application, interaction" and more ([Söhngen et al. 2016](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/44/D1/D581/2503137)). Specifically, you can:

- download the BacDive data you need for offline investigation, and

- document your searches and downloads in `.R` scripts, `.Rmd` files, etc.

Thus, BacDiveR can be the basis for a reproducible data analysis pipeline. See [TIBHannover.GitHub.io/BacDiveR][page] for more details, [/news] there for the changelog, and [GitHub.com/TIBHannover/BacDiveR][source] for the latest source code.

It was also built to serve as a demonstration object during [TIB's "FAIR Data & Software" workshop][FDS].

<!-- Paste the above section into the release description

## Installation

1.  Because the [BacDive Web Service requires registration][reg] please do that first 
    and wait for DSMZ staff to grant you access.

2.  Once you have your login credentials, install the [latest BacDiveR release][releases]
    from GitHub with: `if(!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools'); devtools::install_github('TIBHannover/BacDiveR')`.

3.  After installing, follow the instructions on the console to save your login
    credentials locally and restart R(Studio) or run `usethis::edit_r_environ()`
    and ensure it contains the following:

```
BacDive_email=your.email@provider.org
BacDive_password=YOUR_20_char_password
```

In the examples and vignettes, the data retrieval will only work if your login credentials are correct in themselves (no typos) _and_ were correctly saved. Console output like `"{\"detail\": \"Invalid username/password\"}"`, or `Error: $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors` indicates that either the login credentials are incorrect, or the `.Renviron` file.


## How to use

There are two main functions: [`retrieve_data()`][r_d] and [`retrieve_search_results()`][r_s_r].
Please click on their names to read their docu, and find real-life examples in
the vignettes ["BacDive-ing in"][dive-in] and ["Pre-Configuring Advanced Searches"][adv-search].

[r_d]: https://tibhannover.github.io/BacDiveR/reference/bd_retrieve.html
[r_s_r]: https://tibhannover.github.io/BacDiveR/reference/bd_retrieve_by_search.html
[dive-in]: https://tibhannover.github.io/BacDiveR/articles/BacDive-ing-in.html
[adv-search]: https://tibhannover.github.io/BacDiveR/articles/pre-configuring-advanced-searches-and-retrieving-the-results.html


## How to cite: See [`Cite as` & `Export` on Zenodo][zenodo]

You can also run `citation('BacDiveR')` in the R console and use its output because that
ensures you are citing exactly the installed version.

If you want to import [this repo's metadata][GH] into a reference manager directly, I
recommend [Zotero] and its [GitHub translator][zotGH]. Please double-check, that
the citation refers to the same version number that you ran your analysis with.

When using BibTeX, you may want to try changing the item type from to `@Software`
;-) [Support for that is being worked on](https://github.com/FORCE11/FORCE11-sciwg).

Don't forget to also [cite BacDive itself](https://bacdive.dsmz.de/about) whenever
you used their data, regardless of access method.
